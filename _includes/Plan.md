# Plan

The goal of this is to generate an OpenSource equivalent to something like the [BearTooth(http://beartooth.com)

## Hardware

For a SDR capable "base-station", there are two potential ways to approach this:

1. Root an Android phone and run the SDR directly.

2. Use an embedded controller like a raspberry pi 3 to make a Jed set "base station" using on-board wifi or bluetooth tethering.

An rtlsdr isnâ€™t going to do 2.4ghz sniffing, and is receive only.
A hackrf is half-duplex and can only transmit _or_ receive at any given time.

For full-duplex SDR, the two primary contenders are:

 - Nuand BladeRF: https://github.com/Nuand/bladeRF
 - LimeSDR: http://www.limemicro.com/

Alternatively, two half-duplex devices would suffice.

For half-duplex, he did look at the TI cc1111 based devices:

  - http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/cc1110-cc1111.pdf

Such as:

  - https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/yardstick/wiki/YARD-Stick-One
  - http://gollumrf.com/
  - http://int3.cc/collections/usb/products/rfcat

Those do top out at 1Ghz, however.

Other promising TI chipsets that also support 2.4Ghz are the CC1310 and CC1350:

  - http://www.ti.com/tool/launchxl-cc1310
  - http://www.ti.com/tool/launchxl-cc1350
  - http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/CC13xx_CC26xx_Tools_Overview#CC1350_Launchpad
  - http://dev.ti.com/tirex/content/tirtos_cc13xx_cc26xx_2_20_00_06/resources/cc1350LaunchPad/project0/images/cc1350_launchpad_explained.PNG

Of these, LimeSDR looks like it will not ship in time (end of this month).

I have two Nuand BladeRF devices for developing and testing SDR. One with the amplifier, one without.
